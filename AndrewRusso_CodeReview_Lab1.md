I was unable to run the code due to issues with SQL on my end. So sadly I was unable to test the program itself. That said, I really like the way you wrote this. The code looks great, is consistent with spacing and comments. For my price look up I combined the look up for greater than and less than to find all prices within a range. While I don’t think the “ascending” is needed in the orderby statement I think it is probably good practice to include it, if only to help add to the readability of the code.

For the front end you might consider consistently having either the greater than or less than option being the first option within each category. Personally I find that trying to keep even small things like that in order can help me down the road with consistency. This can be especially true if we ever need to come back and expand on a program.
