Code Compilation and Warnings:
   - The code appears to be in the right syntax, and there are no compiler or runtime errors.
   - No mention of compiler warnings in the provided code.

Readability and Documentation:
   - The code is very readable, with comments explaining the purpose of different sections.
   - Variable and method names are reasonably descriptive.

Code Improvement:
   - Repetitive code is present in some methods, such as creating a new `ProductDBDataContext` and assigning results to the `productDataGridView`.
   - Consider creating a method to handle common operations to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

Repetitive Code and Dead Code:
   - Repetitive code for creating a new `ProductDBDataContext` and assigning results could be factored into a separate method.
   - No apparent dead code in the provided snippet.

Software Defects and Testing:
   - No specific software defects can be found.
   - Tests very well, each button and text box performs operations correctly and efficiently.

Exception Handling:
   - Basic exception handling is in place, such as checking if a number is entered before performing operations.
   - Displaying a message box for an empty number entry is a good practice.
   - Consider providing more specific error messages for better user guidance.

Appropriateness of Framework and Code Usage:
   - The usage of a Windows Forms application and LINQ for data querying seems appropriate for this context.

Differences in Approach:
   - The author's solution involves creating a new form and disposing of the current form when the "Reset" button is clicked. This is a good way to
     handle the reset functionality which is something I did not do.
   - The authors UI was also different than mine. He imported the table directly onto the form which gived the user more clarity and usability.

Preferred Approach:
    - This authors approach aligns well with the assignment requirements.
    - I personally prefer this authors approach, the overal efficiency and usuability of the program was in better shape.

Constructive Feedback:
    - Overall a very well written program, giving clear instructions to the user and all controls operated as they should with no known defects.
    - Consider creating a method for common operations, reducing redundancy in code.
    - Provide more comments to explain complex logic blocks or operations for better understanding.
    - Enhance error messages for better user guidance.
