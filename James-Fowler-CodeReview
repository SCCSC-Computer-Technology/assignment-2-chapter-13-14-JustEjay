Code was written very well 
Your error handling was great but maybe just add something that reminds people to input numbers instead of letters when needed.
I clear text button would be super helpful to people instead of having ot just deleted it themselves but obviously this is just to clean things up
Your comments are very helpful and I was able to keep up with the code.
Most of the things that need to be cleaned up are just tweaks but have no effect on the program overall
Enjoyed looking over this project
